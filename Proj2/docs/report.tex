\begin{abstract}
This paper is a brief analysis of our solution of the 
\href{https://erich-friedman.github.io/puzzle/chessnum/}{Chess-Num} problem, developed
in the context of the PLOG U.C. The solution is implemented in sicstus prolog using its
finite domain constraints library (clpfd).

\section{Introduction}

In this paper we describe our solution to the \href{https://erich-friedman.github.io/puzzle/chessnum/}{Chess-Num}
problem, which can solve any instance of the puzzle, generate a random solution, and
present the result in a human readable way.
We start by describing the problem, afterwards we explain our implementation, and 
then we analyze the solution/approach.

We weren't able to find any other approaches/references to this problem.

\section{Problem Description}

The Chess-Num problem is a chess-related puzzle in which, given a set of
numbered cells in the chess board, one tries to place the six different chess
pieces (rook, queen, king, bishop, knight pawn) in such a way that the number
of each given cell corresponds to the number of pieces attacking that cell.
The \href{https://erich-friedman.github.io/puzzle/chessnum/}{source} of this
problem has a description of this problem and examples of boards and their solution.

\end{figure}

\section{Approach}
\subsection{Decision Variables}

The decision variables correspond to the coordinate pair of each piece. They are all
within the domain [0, 7] (inclusive). Furthermore, all of these coordinate pairs are
distinct both between each other, as well from the given numbered cells' coordinates.

\subsection{Constraints}

\section{Solution Presentation}

The main (outermost) predicates that allow for a problem/solution visualization
are the \inlinecode{display\_board/1} and the \inlinecode{display\_board/2} predicates.

\subsection{The \inlinecode{display\_board(+NumberedSquares)} predicate}

This predicate will draw a chess board with the given numbered squares coordinates
showing the given values. This is used to show a problem without its solution. It
should be noted that the predicates used to visually represent a solution do so
"on-the-fly". This means that only the input data structures are used instead of
a \textit{game board} structure being generated and displayed.

The call display\_board([[1, 0]-1, [3, 0]-6, [4, 2]-2, [3, 4]-0]). yields the
following:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/display_board_1.png}
  \caption{The textual representation of the puzzle show in fig1~\ref{fig:fig1}
  (without its solution).}\label{fig2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The \inlinecode{display\_board(+NumberedSquares, +Coords)} predicate}

Similarly to display\_board/1, this predicate will draw a chess board with the given
numbered cells. Along side those, the pieces in the given coordinates will also be
represented. The representation of each piece is as follows: King - \textbf{K},
Queen - \textbf{Q}, Rook - \textbf{R}, Bishop - \textbf{B}, Knight - \textbf{Kn},
and Pawn - \textbf{P}.

The call display\_board([[1, 0]-1, [3, 0]-6, [4, 2]-2, [3, 4]-0],
[[3, 1], [6, 0], [2, 0], [0, 3], [1, 1], [4, 1]]). yields the following:

\section{Experiments and Results}
\subsection{Dimensional analysis}
\subsubsection{The impact of the quantity of numbered squares}
The problem in fig1~\ref{fig:fig1} is the simplest problem we found with
an unique solution. Our solver finds that solution in about 0.02// TODO seconds.
From the problems in the puzzle's web page, this is the one that is solved
the fastest.

This puzzle has four numbered squares, one of which has the value 6. This
is of note because, we always start constraining the pieces coordinates
in a that they can attack the given numbered square. A numbered square with
value 6 implies that all six pieces are attacking it, thus pruning the
possible coordinates for the pieces by a lot.

We can compare this puzzle to the following which also has a single solution,
but no numbered square with the value 6. It takes about 1.04 seconds to
find the solution. This is significantly higher than the previous one
even though there are the same number of numbered squares.

The more numbered squares the puzzle has, the longer it takes to solve it.

\subsubsection{The special case for the value 0}
As previously stated, our constraints are posted aggressively on the attack
for each for each numbered square. This is very inefficient when the numbered
square we're dealing with has value 0 (no one can attack it). This led us to
create a special case for these numbered squares where we explicitly constraint
all pieces to not attack the numbered square from the get go, instead of
trying to attack it first.

\subsubsection{The processing order of numbered squares}

\subsection{A Subsection Sample}
Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

line.

Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.

For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
